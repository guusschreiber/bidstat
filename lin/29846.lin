nt|ritong: the idea is, when responder's hand is not limited, it leaves him more room if he really has a rockcrusher|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: 4@D is nonserious slam try (certainly agree with the nonserious part)|pg||

mb|p|mb|5H|nt|sixela: they will be in 6, -11 imps|pg||
mb|p|nt|dburn: but that's the trouble - West feels obliged to cue the @dA in case East has a huge hand with three little diamonds|pg||
mb|6H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|sixela: depends on your agreements, if 4D is any kind of voluntary slam try, it is too much|pg||
nt|djneill:  they might play serious 3N *and* last train, so 4@d just denies the bottom 10% of hands - this might be around that |pg||
nt|sixela: if 3H is slammish, demanding a cue bid, then 4D shows nothing extra and E can bid 4H knowing that his pd will continue with extras|pg||
pc|d5|nt|djneill:  with a @d guess and @h or @c behaving, it's an easy Roland slam :-)|pg||
nt|dburn: good players are supposed to underlead kings more often than jacks against slams|pg||
nt|djneill:  but that's another hand|pg||
nt|djneill:  this is a @d lead auction tho|pg||
nt|dburn: indeed|pg||
nt|djneill:  West clearly needs the @h9 for 4@d :-)|pg||
nt|dburn: at the other table West, in the same auction, made no kind of slam try - serious, frivolous or otherwise|pg||

nt|nilsland:  because N only has 2 clubs declarer will always make 4@H if he guess the hand - and after @CK and another he may do that|pg||
nt|ritong: for instance, if he admits that EW are in an eight cards fit, his pard has one trump, likely not two singletons|pg||
nt|ritong: so he has two @ss|pg||

nt|ritong: on the other hand, leading a @c would be a huge committment|pg||
nt|ahollan1: Bessis wondering:  who started with 1@S|pg||
nt|Vugraphzff: Bessis has his head in his hands, deep in thought|pg||
nt|warrens:  he knows not to play a @S, since if his partner shows out, he won't be able to ruff and that would reveal the trump split|pg||
nt|ritong: bonjour warren|pg||

nt|dburn: in some systems 2@c over 1NT shows majors anyway|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: all true|pg||
nt|djneill:  now they might get to 5@d making sometimes|pg||

nt|ritong: his problem is: what if i play the @s K and south shows out|pg||
nt|ritong: because with trumps 4/1 contract is home|pg||
