{
If you wander into 7S, you will make it and score heavily. This
is likely to happen if South starts with a strong 2S over 1D.
North will soon use Blackwood. If South shows his void (5NT),
North might not bother about the SQ. After "only" 1S, the 4th
suit auctions may focus too much on the minors and both level
and strain will be problematic. Deutsch did jump shift and the
auction followed predictable lines

is likely to push E/W to 3C. Here Weinstein\\'s 1C was raised to
2C (constructive) but there was no reason for West to look for

An unexpected auction. Levin\\'s 4-6 Flannery created a strained
series of bids. Hamman was forced to treat his hand as a diamond
one-suiter, leading to 3NT which might have made. When Weinstein
belatedly introduced his clubs, he did not reckon on Levin returning
to hearts where they rested, doubled and down 800. [There must
be something wrong with a method that does not permit you to
play in your eight-card trump suit (SRK).] DA, DQ to K, HQ from
Zia, club, club ruffed, heart. Declarer lost 3 spades.

Surrealistic Pillow. Helgemo\\'s responsive double with great defense
and mediocre offense, was very risky. This does not explain Chagas\\'
3S where both 3D and 3C would seem more normal. (He assumed that
Helgemo would have 4S -- the product of an unfamiliar partnership.)
Worse, when Helgemo assumed the 5th spade, he bid on rather than
double, turning +500 into -400. To say no double, no trouble,
would be an understatement

{
Chagas/Helgemo brushed aside Levy\\'s strong NT overcall to reach
a normal, slightly pushy, 4S contract. Chemla\\'s club lead, although
it set up a second club trick, left Chagas with an entry problem.
Chagas overtook the club queen to finesse in trumps, and later
had to guess the doubleton DJ. Levy counted out for 3-2-2-6 and
Chagas thought he would not have overcalled NT with Ax of diamonds.
Great result.

After Chemla showed at least a limit raise in hearts, Levy drove

finesse the CQ and cash the DA. +980.

Great scope for variation. Should East keep 1H alive? We say
yes. Will West try for game? Yes, if hearts are raised. However,
if East starts with a semi-forcing 1NT and gives preference,
N/S may compete and finish in 2 or 3 spades. 3H has no chance,
and even 2H requires some play. N/S stand to take 8 tricks in
spades with careful play...Casen did not reopen against 2H. D10
to A, trump switch, Q, CJ. Now declarer can take the ruffing
finesse against the CA and lose only five tricks. +110. For N/S
to enter the auction, North must protect with 2S. Is this realistic?

If North boosts South\\'s weak 2S to 3, he may silence his opponents.
If he passes instead, East will reopen with a double and West
is likely to jump to 4H. 3S is one down. 4H has play, but will
probably fail when declarer misguesses the diamonds. Is it better,
then, to have loved and lost? When Cohen passed 2S, Lindkvist
eschewed the normal takeout double in favor of 3D. He then passed
his partner\\'s 3H. This was high enough as he lost two spades,
a club, a diamond and a trump.

E/W will coast into 4S which is likely to fail if North has opened
1C and South leads the suit. If North opens 1D, however, the

East will continue with 3C, and again West has a difficult bid.
3S will end the auction, but 3NT will be a tempting alternative
for West. That\\'s too high and down two would be an expected result.
Blanchard slithered with 3D over 3C which got him to 3S. Flesher

6C with a heart lead? First, Bramley ducked his SA (something
a less experienced player would not have considered - SRK), so
did not shorten declarer\\'s trumps. Then Smith ruffed out the
SA using the trump ace and returned to his hand with dummy\\'s

3NT looks good but plays poorly. After spades are cleared, to
reach the dummy for the proven club finesse, declarer must collapse
his diamond tricks.  Here, however, the heart lead located the
HA (West would never duck the HA). Woolsey now was able to lead
the HK when the clubs did not break, and force a ninth trick
in hearts, making it okay to overtake the DQ with the DK for
the club finesse.

danger potential in 5C by bidding 3NT directly. 9 tricks on top,
with 5C down one on an inspired diamond ruff.

RSW: If  South opens a risky vulnerable 2S and North raises to
3, a practical 5C by East gets the zero. 4NT, instead may get
West to jump to 6D making. SRK: However, should North raise pre-emptively
to 4S, East is up against it. 4NT (2-suit takeout) would work
well, but a direct 5C.... EOK: When Hamilton did not open 2S,
Bates/Larsen could have tried 6D over 4D, but settled for a heart

With a trump break required for starters, and clear handling
charges, 6H is plenty. 7H can be made on a spade/diamond squeeze.
The alternative line of ruffing two spades in dummy will fail
with a club lead. Bates\\' 1S overcall (the previous hand surely
having an influence) created a RKC scenario ending at 7H. Lovely?
Ping Pong. Spade to the queen and ace. Hamilton, fearing bad
breaks, drew lots of trumps. Larsen discarded a spade on the
4th round of trumps, and Bates now could not protect all the

If West opens 1S or 2S (S+m), E/W will have to judge well to

4S by ruffing the heart and passing the SJ. Then 3 high clubs,
North ruffing. Gawrys ruffed the H return, led to the SA, and
played on clubs, North discarding a H&D. Then a H ruff and the
DA for an elegant 10 tricks. More than a decade ago M Lindkvist
(playing with Fallenius) incurred the largest penalty in World
Championship history (-3400). Deja voodoo. On this deal at another
table, he and Fredin went 7 down redoubled in 6S for the same

After West\\'s 2D overcall, Rodwell, East, taking no half measures,
jumped to 3NT. Kerri Sanborn led her 4th best club to North\\'s
jack. Rodwell ducked. North returned a club and South ducked!
Rodwell forthwith led and passed the D8, then finessed the jack.
6 diamonds, 1 club and 2 hearts added up to 9 tricks. South might
have scuppered the contract by covering the D8, blocking the
suit, but this does not detract from Rodwell\\'s ingenious play.

Rodwell\\'s freely bid 4C might not occur to lesser players, and
West did well to pass what some might consider a forcing bid.
A spade was led and North shifted to a diamond. East won the
Ace, crossed to a heart and led a second diamond. He now had
the entries to ruff the diamonds good and draw trumps to accord
yet another good score. After an initial club lead by Kerri,
or a club shift at trick 2, even Rodwell\\'s skill would not have
sufficed.

4S is a decent contract for E/W which only depends on the trump
break. However, South is unlikely to let them play with his strong
playing hand, and his likely 5C also fails by a trick. Academic!
Zia\\'s weak 2 spades was doubled by South and he doubled again
when West\\'s 3S came back to him. Billy Cohen decided to take
his chances. Where\\'s the blame for this disaster? North might
have removed the 2nd double to 3NT, but at least 2 of the commentators
(EOK and SRK) lay the blame on South\\'s door, feeling that he
should have preferred 4C at his second turn. A massive swing
for the Paki-American axis.

Although E/W can always make 6C from the East side and on a non-spade

Gitelman did not raise to 3H but Jacobs settled for 3C and that

Possible auction: (2S)-2NT-(P)-3D(transfer); (P)-3H-(P)-3NT.
There is no obvious 9th trick and 5D looks easier, but in practice,
East may return a spade if declarer ducks the first spade. An
auction like the one we projected (Gitelman refusing to "take"
the transfer, somewhat dangerously, as Moss could have had lots
of hearts and a weak hand). Jacobs led a club to concede the
9th trick. Good for the contending pair.

Hamman-Mahmood got to 2S, not being able to investigate for their
9-card fit, and scrambled home with the contract. Their reasonable
result was neutralized by Chagas-Helgemo\\'s exuberant bidding
to 5C, for a loss of 3 IMPs.

The only point of interest is North\\'s choice of opening bid in
fourth position. Wold opted for 1S where Chagas preferred a "practical"
4S. Opening 1S caters to the possibility, even opposite a passed
hand, of reaching a six diamond contract on a 4-4 or 5-4 fit
and using the spades for discards.

a Michaels Cue Bid. None of these actions would normally affect
the resul as N/S would coast into 3NT

If West raises 2S to 3S, N/S will probably let it play. 3S might
make on neutral defense and with declarer guessing clubs and
building a second heart trick. But it is not simple. Schiesses-Knap
did lead the club king, but versus 2S. The carding confused South,
who switched to the heart king allowing a ninth trick

A good 6C, but Garozzo-Reisig stop in 3NT (+720) after East was
able to show 5H and honor-doubleton in spades. Clubs were never
mentioned. Knap competed with an artificial 1S over Meckstroth\\'s
strong 1C. That served to bury the clubs, but the N/S diamond

N/S should discover their S duplication and stop safely at 4H.
Greco-Hampson did that after a 1NT opoening by North. He made
6, however, when Reisig led a sensible (on the auction) diamond.
Knap-Schiesser also stopped safely, but on a slightly convoluted
auction after the same 1NT opening. The C5 was not a standout
lead but it proved safe enough and so gained an IMP.

East might try 1H over 1C to compete for the partscore (it\\'s
clearly not for the lead!) and might get his side to 3H for +140.
If East passes, South is likely to respond 1S or a natural 2C,
getting N/S too high in 2NT or 3C. Reisig defended prettily against
Hampson\\'s 2NT, after knocking out the heart ace. On the clubs
he threw two diamonds and two spades. Hampson exited in spades,
but Reisig put Garozzo in with the third heart for the vital
diamond switch - one down.Sure enough, Rodwell did come in with
1H, raised to 3H. Knap doubled for takeout but Schiesser passed
for penalty - cold for 530. With both four spades and a club
fit, that pass is fraught with danger.

Normal 1NT by south on a spade or club lead. Both of our Wests
led a spade to the Jack and Ace. South led the heart King to
the Ace. On this trick, Rodwell followed with the heart 6, which
looks like a negative Smith signal (upside down everything) about
spades. If so, Meckstroth did particularly well to switch to
the diamond queen, which Schiesser might have ducked. He took
it, however, and made only 5 tricks. Reisig followed low to the
first heart (Garozzo\\'s Ace). Garozzo shifted to a club, took
the second heart and cashed clubs, then exited in hearts. Not
best here - plus 90. 5 IMPs to Meckwell.

Meckstroth opened 3D while Garozzo passed. Imperfect preempts
seem to be the order of the day in the expert world, but Garozzo
has remained true to his principles. His pass led to a quiet

with 3H over 3D, momentum got him to 4H, which was much easier
to double - down 500 and 8 IMPs to Schiesser. Grazie, Benito.

It would be easy to reach the inferior 3NT if East opened 1NT.
But in our match, Easts treated their hands as spades and extra
values (in different ways - Berkowitz\\' 1C was strong) +680 and
+650.The scoring method places huge emphasis on 1, 2, and 3-IMP
differences in the total match score, so overtricks can kill
you.   Weinstein\\'s club lead cost 1 IMP.

Both Wests passed their marginal (Culbertson 2 1/2 honor tricks)
hand, but bid aggressively thereafter to reach the excellent

North may not have an opening bid in the eyes of the world, but
Wold\\'s 2D (majors? Or Multi?) put the lie to that. And in truth,
this bid jockeyed Berkowitz/Cohen into their normal, but unlucky
3NT. The spade lead blew a trick, but the defense was able to
develop clubs with the HK as an entry, -50. It\\'s hard to find
fault with Seamon-Passell\\'s auction which landed them in a 25-point
2NT. Club ten to the king. In refusing to set up a second club
for declarer, Weinstein gave him time for three heart tricks,
+120. 5 IMPs to Brachman..

There are ten top tricks in 6S if only you can get at them, but
declarer has no fast entry to dummy. A heart lead, or a club
honor are the most troublesome.  Meckstroth led a diamond, however.
Helgemo won and made the winning play -- a low spade. Meckstroth
won and played the CQ, but that netted only 3 defensive tricks.
Good for The Dream Team. Same diamond lead versus Greco, who
played ace and another trump, a play that could easily have been
best. Zia encouraged a club switch. Three rounds of clubs left
Greco with a heart to lose. 10 IMPs.

Both E/W pairs stopped accurately in 3H. On a double dummy basis,
9 tricks are the limit on the lead of the ace and a diamond followed
by a club shift. In practice, both Norths started with the imaginative
CK and both Wests made 12 tricks (probably retretting that they
weren\\'t playing auction bridge).

An attenuated opening bid from North, Geoff Hampson, propelled
his side into 2NT. After the CK lead and a spade shift, declarer
led a heart to the jack, winning 8 tricks. In the other room,
E/W bought the contract in 3S. This could have been beaten 2
tricks as the play went, but South would have had to win the
2nd diamond with the queen to unblock, a slightly risky play
when he was sure of down one.

It\\'s easy to imagine E/W getting to 5S, where they must guess
the SQ to make. Hampson\\'s 1H led to a decision for Lev over 2H.
Fortunately, he had a natural 2NT available (if not, perhaps
pass is better than a responsive X--EOK). 4S, +650. Gawrys had
a 2-suited 2H at his disposal, which led Meckstroth to a slightly
different problem over 3H. He passed and was able to stay low.
4S made 6 on a heart lead and a diamond switch. 1IMP to Johnson.

of Gawrys (especially) and Hampson, who gambled that South\\'s
likely spade shortage would accompany diamond length. Bingo.

fourth from the longest and strongest -- led the C2. This did
not wound declarer who, with the aid of 3 diamond tricks, wound
up with two overtricks. In the other room, East, Mansell, started
with an even less promising card, the D7. Reading the lead, declarer
was able to garner 4 diamond tricks, but fell from grace at the
end, taking the spade finesse when the defenders had set up enough
tricks to hold him to 1. 2 IMPs to Hansell.

In one room, the Polish pair fetched up in a modest contract
at the one level, in a slightly inferior trump suit. 10 tricks
were made due to the favorable diamond lie. The other North,
Hampson, a devotee of the Meckstroth-Rodwell methods, opened
a light 1D. A competitive auction led N/S to 4S. When this got
doubled, South retreated to the haven of his more secure trump
suit. This, too, was doubled, but was cold. +550 and a gain of
9 IMPs.

Both E/Ws bid briskly to 3NT after North opened the bidding.
The respective Souths did well to lead a heart, and when North
inserted the 9, declarer was headed for defeat. However, at both
tables, curiously enough, North did NOT cover the jack of clubs,
and declarer was able to take 3 club tricks, 5 diamonds and the
HA. Perhaps the Norths were playing declarer for AQ109 of clubs.
One can sympathize, but not necessarily approve, particularly

a spade, of course, and now Fleisher has a late spade entry to
