nt|dburn: well, it was played from the less terrible side - the one that would not necessarily get a spade lead|pg||
pc|c6|pc|c3|pc|c7|pg||
nt|dburn: you might catch South with a marginal good hand including heart length, I guess|pg||
nt|kit: The diamonds are friendly, but declarer will still need to double hook the spades rather than a spade to the king -- that might not be so clear.|pg||
nt|warrens:  I'm keeping my comment on  49.  Making required 3-3 @H's and no @S lead.  But, as they say, they pay bonuses for game|pg||

mb|3D|an|preemptive raise|nt|dburn: 3@d might be a mild diversion|pg||
nt|dburn: or not - just a 3@s bid in a different guise|pg||
nt|kit: really an odd way to play it -- the artificial call (giving opponents more room) being the preemptive raise|pg||
nt|warrens:  West would like to bid 3@s asking for a @S stopper, but it's probably some version of Michaels|pg||
nt|dburn: I guess the idea is that partner can bid 3@h to ask "are you only mildly terrible or are you Ivan the Terrrible?"|pg||

nt|dburn: not sure he was worth that, but maybe he hoped either to have a play for 4@s or to goad the bad guys into 5@d|pg||

nt|Henryb:  everything starts with a heart to the 9|pg||
nt|nilsland:  7@H i mean|pg||
nt|dburn: still, you'd need a pretty sharp operator before you put your money on him. Thomas Bessis is one such operator.|pg||
pc|s3|pc|sK|pc|s5|pc|s8|pg||

nt|dburn: remember, West wanted a diamond...|pg||
nt|fabsayc: that points against a spade lead|pg||
nt|Henryb:  If this makes, I think we have a tie|pg||
nt|ritong: 470 is ten imps|pg||
nt|nilsland:  that is possible yes if 630 was 660|pg||
nt|Henryb:  apparently there is a probable imp to Grue on 63|pg||
nt|dburn: if this makes the BBO score is 112-111|pg||
nt|dburn: but the official score may be different|pg||
nt|ritong: yes|pg||
nt|ahollan1: seems on auction  @CK  @D to Ace @C2 clarifies defense|pg||

nt|ahollan1: but --- wrong again Al|pg||
nt|dburn: ...now it might|pg||
nt|ritong: moment of truth|pg||
nt|dburn: Bessis might have played that diamond earlier, but of course West could have a stiff club|pg||
nt|jkotor: Bas Drijver had not guessed right last board :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: vs them :)|pg||
nt|jkotor: now my other fellow opponent from junior times, Thomas...|pg||
nt|Henryb:  anyway, If Bessis does not play a club, don't leave. we might have overtime|pg||
nt|reisig: So -- we could have a play-off?|pg||
nt|Henryb:  and after two overtime periods a shootout|pg||
nt|ahollan1: i'm being fed questions about validity of score on 52 -- so keep in mind  BBO Score is UNOFFICIAL|pg||
nt|Henryb:  No, I was not serious about shootout|pg||
nt|weedo: club seems clear|pg||
nt|nilsland:  East may think that West may not know who has the @C8 (if West have the @C10)|pg||
nt|ahollan1: hideous hog:  if you're going to do the wrong thing -- do it quickly|pg||
nt|ritong: but he was talking to the rueful rabbit|pg||
nt|dburn: how many Spingolds did the Hideous Hog win?|pg||
nt|ritong: i would not risk that comparison:)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  I agree that W would play the 10 with AQ@D but what else could he be thinking about|pg||
nt|dburn: not sure I can see anything compelling Bessis one way or the other|pg||
nt|ritong: for those among you wondering, east does not know where the @c 10 is  plus his pard doubled 4@d|pg||
nt|Henryb:  We think, but not sure, that on 63 Grue made 660 and we know Jag made 630|pg||
nt|ahollan1: that's why i thought trick 2 would be @D6|pg||
nt|ahollan1: the only time that is wrong is when @CJ lead was singleton AND not getting 2 tricks in @D|pg||
nt|nilsland:  bye the way thank you all kibs for your help , comments and analyses - see you soon again|pg||
nt|Henryb:  No, Jan told us that in fact Bessis won trick 13 with @dJ|pg||

nt|reisig: No pressure|pg||
nt|nilsland:  gn Henry and thx for helping|pg||
nt|dburn: not really - declarer may have enough spades to pitch dummy's clubs|pg||
nt|ritong: i wonder if bertheau regrets to have doubled 4@d now|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: Bessis: "I don't know"|pg||
nt|Henryb:  Please note, we do not have the official score here|pg||

nt|Vugraphzfc: Gawel: "now I will be thinking for 15 minutes"|pg||
nt|jkotor: clubs 5-2, soo, should play A@h?|pg||
nt|dburn: of course, declarer still needs to pick up the hearts, but maybe East wasn't looking at @hQ for all that thinking|pg||
nt|dburn: but it is not over yet|pg||
nt|jkotor: he knows @c r 5-2, and @d 2-4|pg||
nt|jkotor: so mostly he should start A@h, then try to guess finess or top , but Q falls first|pg||
