Onstott, leading with 163, drew Mike Moss\\'s team. Welland, 5
VP behind, drew Deutsch. Onstott did well, winning 21-9 in VP.
For Welland to triumph, a win by at least 24 IMPs was required.
Different players will give you different opinions about how
much North needs to bid 1NT in Fred Gitelman\\'s position but most
of them would raise to game with Brad Moss\\'s hand, unwilling
to cut it too fine. A passive lead would have left Gitelman with
an uphill struggle but Alain Levy led a low spade. That gave
a trick and an entry for a second diamond finesse. Two spades,
four diamonds and ace-king-ace: plus 400. [Your host: Eric Kokish]

Billy Cohen/Ron Smith evaluated their cards in the same fashion
as their counterparts, but here Steve Garner found a more effective
lead than his seatmate in the SQ, showing the king but a moderate
holding. Howard Weinstein unblocked the ten under dummy\\'s ace
so the suit remained fluid for the defense. When Cohen played
diamonds from the top, he was not going to be able to find enough
tricks on this layout and careful defense held him to seven winners
even though he was able to set up a long club. Two down; minus
100. 11 IMPs to Welland.

Levy\\'s sequence showed, I believe, a slam try with a one-suiter
in hearts. Paul Chemla didn\\'t have much of a notrump to start
with and it didn\\'t improve as the auction progressed, but the
contract was normal enough, if not particularly good. Levy must
have revealed spade shortness en route to 6H for Gitelman\\'s lead
of the S8 would otherwise be strange. Chemla needed a twelfth
trick and didn\\'t get it when he led the first diamond to the
king and ace and Moss was able to guard diamonds in the endgame:
minus 100.

{
Garner used a Texas transfer, then showed his spade void. With
spades on his right and hating his hand, Weinstein tried to retreat
to 4NT but Garner thought he had too much to honor that opinion.
Weinstein tested clubs before committing himself in diamonds
lest the jack-ten were doubleton with the DA in South, and although
he led the first diamond to the queen, Cohen could discard behind
declarer\\'s minor-suit holding and there was no twelfth trick.
The record suggests that he played North for the doubleton DA;
down one: minus 100. No swing. Welland, 11-0.

N/S don\\'t have the cards to justify bidding 4S, but single dummy
it would not be the worst vulnerable game ever attempted. Gitelman/Moss

Cohen used a different version of Drury, 2D suggesting four-card
spade support. The bidding would have ended at 2S here too but
Weinstein, expecting to find no spades and probably only five
hearts opposite (no weak two-bid) bravely competed with 3C. With
N/S having described their spade length there was no obvious
need to push on to 3S and Weinstein was left to scramble at 3C.
The defense was as gentle as could be, setting up declarer\\'s
SQ and allowing him to draw trumps and enjoy two ruffs and the
D10. Ten winners: plus 130. 7 IMPs to Welland, ahead 18-0.

Moss\\'s 3C was a puppet to 3D and his 3H showed 5H and genuine
club support. The hands did not fit well, however, and even though
it was natural to play hearts for one loser, the diamond lead
did bad things to declarer\\'s communications. Moss was more or
less forced to take the diamond finesse and could not avoid losing
a diamond, two clubs, and a trump for one down: minus 50. 4H
is quite a bit better from the North side, which highlights the

It\\'s difficult to see why Moss would do anything other than raise

absenvce of wasted values make 6C a superb contract. 3NT can
often withstand an unfortunate club lie while 6C cannot, but

Were it not for the missing ace-king of trumps 6S would be an

by giving up at the four-level after Moss\\'s very strong auction
(although the distinction between 3D/4D and a direct 4D may be
significant for the partnership). Although the defense did best
by forcing dummy twice, Gitelman was able to ruff his last diamond

Smith\\'s 4D splinter is the action most experts would choose and
there is no denying that South has a good hand for spades. I
consider this mildly dangerous because South might have an extra
ace and some bits kicking. North might move toward slam on that
basis when the 5-level might be too high. I am surprised that
Cohen offered no slam try, but had he done so with 4H, Smith
would have retreated to 4S. Here too the defenders played on
diamonds, but Cohen ruffed the third club to get back to his

talk his opponents out of a club lead. He would, of course, rather
have them start with diamonds or maybe a spade, perhaps to establish
a trick there. No such luck. East had an easy club lead from

Levy\\'s passed-hand double showed a singe-suited hand and Chemla
may have been tempted to pass. He settled for a dutiful 2C, which
catered to Levy\\'s actual hand. Weinstein, rich in aces, doubled
for takeout, hoping for a penalty pass, but Levin retreated to
2D. A heart lead from East didnt cause any problems for declarer,
as a spade would have done. Here Levin simply let the H10 go
to his queen (West ducked), drew two rounds of trumps and gave
up a heart. A spade loser could be discarded on a heart.

to 3C. Weinsteins 3H asked for a heart stopper but Levin\\'s "strong"
raise was based on distribution and he preferred to try for game
in clubs. As he might have  expected, his HK turned out to be
a worthless card when West led his partners suit. Three red

More Europeans coming in, this time Anton Maas/Vincent Ramondt,
well-known Dutch internationals. They were selected only yesterday
to play for their country in the European Championships next
month. Earlier this year, bridge players in Holland voted for
"best player in the country," and the winner was Maas. But at
the same time, the question was put to the experts, and then
Ramondt came out first. Lets see how Weinstein and Levin fare

A natural, if somewhat curious, Dutch auction. If Souths 2NT
was indeed invitational it looks both a bit pessimistic (with
such good clubs) and presumptuous (with that heart holding),

However, all went well for the Dutch. North had hearts stopped,

Fleisher decided to rebid the hearts, rather than showing his
pretty good diamonds. After a club lead to Souths ace a trump
lead looked natural with the spade holding that South had. This
made it easy for declarer to make two overtricks, ruffing a club
and establishing a spade trick. N/S minus 480. Five pairs were
more ambitious, bidding slam, all in hearts. Two made it, three
didnt. Fleisher/Rodwell gained another 30 IMPs.

Although the Italians employ a little science, it doesn\\'t help
them to reach the best contract on this deal - not that finding
5D is easy in any system. 2C is strong and artificial; 2D is
negative; 2H is either natural or a balanced hand with 25+ HCP;
2S is a relay; and 2NT shows the balanced powerhouse. Then, Versace
uses Stayman and signs off in 3NT when there is no 4-4 heart
fit. In an ideal world, the weak hand is able to describe what
he has instead of asking what his partner has, leaving the strong
hand in a position to judge the best strain.

Neither Piotr Gawrys nor Nickell considers his 11-point hand
worth an opening bid, so Amos Kaminski, a former winner of this
event, is left to open 1NT third in hand, after which a Stayman
auction gets him to 4S on the 4-4 fit. When Hamman leads a heart
and Nickell shows up with the ace/king there, it wouldn\\'t be
too unreasonable to play Hamman for the SK, but Kaminski gets
both trumps and clubs right for a fairly normal, but nice-looking,
plus 620.

Twenty years ago, everbody had the same set of responses to Blackwood.
Nowadays, there are many different schemes. When Gawrys overcalls
Hamman\\'s third-seat 3C opening and Nickell decides to raise,
fearing that would only help his opponents, Kaminski has the
chance to issue a cooperative slam try with a 4C cue-bid.

After passing initially, Kaminski (steaming, perhaps) comes
in with a delayed takeout double even though he hold only three
cards in one of the two unbid suits. A lesser player than Gawrys
might skip several levels in diamonds but he is either trying
to steal from his opponents or catering to his partner\\'s eccentricity
when he settles for a quiet 1NT. This has no effect on North/South\\'s
bidding but you can judge for yourself whether it affected the
play.

Greco\\'s 2C is forcing to game, so he can safely rebid 3C over
Hampson\\'s minimum 2NT to suggest slam. With just a bit in reserve,
Hampson tries 3S to show "where he lives" and that is enough
to convince Greco to take a shot at 6C. And with the slam played

Both Eat and West would have opened the South hand, but that
is not Nickell\\'s style. When Greco\\'s 1C opening is greeted by
a natural and invitational 2NT response, his 13-count is in the
middle of the partnership range for a balanced minimum opening,
and it would seem that his mildly conservative decision to pass
is influenced by the vulnerability. With 4432 or a fifth club,
he would probably carry on to game, regardless.

We begin the Friday evening session following a red-hot pair
from middle America. Howard Weinstein and Steve Garner won bronze
medals at the World Teams Olympiad last year, finished second
at the Cap Gemini, and won the Cavendish Teams a day ago. Their
opponents for the first round are scions of the French national
team: multiple world champions - Paul Chemla and Alain Levy.
Weinstein\\'s 2S advance denoted a limit raise or better in diamonds,
which probably had Chemla checking the backs of his cards. Did
everyone have a good hand? Well, yes.

There are some players who would open the East hand with 3C -
Levy isn\\'t one of them. Some strong club pairs though, may start
with a natural 2C opening. When East passed, South opened a two-bid
of his own - a weak 2D. Chemla had an easy non-vulnerable entry
with 2H, and Weinstein nudged the bidding higher. Levy, not wishing
to be left out of the action, countered with a Responsive Double.
He unobtrusively shifted his C2 over to the spade suit to make
the bid more palatable. Fortunately, Chemla held three spades
only, and settled for 3H.

Garner\\'s 2NT advance showed at least four trump, and an opening
bid. Weinstein\\'s 3C rebid showed a minimum hand-type that may
or may not contain shortness. The 3D bid asked about any possible
singleton, and 4H said - "leave me alone, I have a balanced minimum".
That was enough for Garner to stay out of any trouble searching
for slam. Though, as we can see, if the DA and CQ were both onside
- twelve tricks. And, if for some reason, Chemla were to lead
a diamond from Q106 - twelve tricks.

Woolsey\\'s 2D was game-forcing, and when Stewart rebid his hearts,
Woolsey bid game in hearts. This was a tad surprising as South
may have been cornered into rebidding a five-card heart suit
with an unattractive alternative. Maybe a 3C advance by North
would uncover a better strain in notrump or diamonds. In any
case, 4H proved to be a good contract. In essence, declarer had
to hold his trump losers to one trick. In fact, the best contract
is 5D, as it will make even if QJxx of hearts are offside.

N/S would make 3D from the South seat certainly, so Fallenius
chose an excellent time to open a slightly shaded strong-notrump.
Though, N/S held 22 HCP, they simply had no convenient entry
into the auction. The simple transfer auction landed E/W in a
very comfortable contract. But with Garner and Weinstein on defense,
nothing is comfortable. A deadly H5 lead from Garner was taken
by Weinstein\\'s ace. The C5 return went to Garner\\'s queen, and
the CA, and a club ruff followed. The D3 went to Weinstein\\'s

Gitelman-Moss exchanged quite a bit of information on this deal.
They made a valiant attempt to get to a close slam on perfect-fitting
cards. On this particular layout 3NT would prove to be no problem.
However, on a bad day even that contract could fail (imagine
the CQ offside as well). So, this was a well-conducted auction.
After Gitelman\\'s fourth-suit forcing 2C, Moss made a waiting
bid, more or less, with 2D. It\\'s possible in their partnership
that 3C would denote a different hand-type. Gitelman showed what
his fourth-suit-hand was about with 3D.

Just because one suit is unguarded never stopped Zia from opening
notrump, and didn\\'t stop him here. And, why not? The hand falls
in the partnership 2NT range (20-21), and a source of tricks
in spades make the bid almost mandatory. Who wants the rebid
problems after starting with 1S? Eisenberg surprised Zia by transferring
to his five-card suit. He solved this pleasant dilemma with a
super-accept leap to 4S. Moss led the CQ to declarer\\'s ace, and

[Your host for Boards 13-27 is Danny Kleinman.] After a routine
start to the auction, Gitelman entered with a marginal 1S. As
2H suggested four-card sipport, Moss had reason to believe the
N/S hands would fit well, so he made the well-reasoned decision
to raise on king-doubleton. Curtis Cheek, West, was not quite
strong enough to double.

Gitelman was not tempted to go beyond game after Moss replied
to the artificial balanced forcing raise with a discouraging,
balanced rebid. Cheek found an effective diamond lead, which
Moss correctly let ride to Billy Miller\\'s jack. Miller\\'s club
switch set up a discard for dummy\\'s DQ, so the defenders could
get only one trick each in clubs, diamonds and spades. Making
four, plus 620 for +36 IMPs.

a spade shift. Moss shifted to the SJ after declarer drove out
the DA, but declarer had nine easy tricks to make 3NT. Minus

trumps. Zia shifted to the DK late in the play to kill declarer\\'s
DA entry to the clubs (which had been blocked). However, the
third round of diamonds squeezed Eisenberg in hearts and clubs,

A 20-HCP 2NT opening led to a normal three notrump via a Stayman
auction. Rodwell led the SJ from his broken sequence, carefully
avoiding blowing a trick. The four-one diamond split (the "wrong"
way) doomed the contract, but Eisenberg tried a valiant though
futile endplay in an effort to make. Eisenberg\\'s throw-in would
have succeeded had East started with only three clubs and king-empty-fourth
of hearts. Alas, it was not to be: down two, minus 200, an unfortunate

Ferraro probably didnt like the way the bidding went. Was it
Lawrence who recommended overcalling with Souths type of hand?
Anyway, Ferraro passed throughout. He led a diamond to his partners
ace, and got his ruff. It seems futile to play a trump back now
as declarers high cards have to be in hearts, but Ferraro did.
Declarer continued with diamonds, throwing spades as South wouldnt
(couldnt) ruff. It was all over. Nothing could stop declarer
from getting four trump tricks, a spade ruff, two tricks in diamonds

Ferraro began with a shapely (but perhaps not so impressive in

he might make. Ferraro, having little defense but still the shape
understandably thought that he should sacrifice. I wonder what
he would have done over 6C. But it was difficult for E/W to know
that 6C was on, the DK being well placed in spite of South opening.

We all know that Italians play a strong club, but this pair doesnt,

of 3NT Duboin got a club lead, played three rounds of diamonds

Note that Wests 3D was not forcing. This is perhaps an unfamiliar
auction to many who play 2/1, but as Ferraros choice was a nonforcing
1NT, he chose to show an invitational hand with long diamonds.
Duboin, with trump support and three keycards, liked his hand
and accepted the invitation but waved aside the suggestion to
play hearts. After the club lead Ferraro ruffed three clubs in
dummy using the HA and two spade ruffs as entries to his hand.

The present leaders stay E/W, and will take on last years winners,
Marty Fleisher and Eric Rodwell. After everybody had competed,
N/S were left to play 3H. It looks as if the defense can make
two spades and one trick each in the other suits, but have a
look: Ferraro decided to lead dummys suit - Rusinow style, the
nine - against 3H, and Duboin, convinced that it was a singleton,
returned the suit. To get a spade back he played the D7, his
highest, which set up an extra diamond trick in dummy.

It looks like Fleisher and Rodwell had a misunderstanding here.
When 2NT was passed around to South, he bid 3C which seems natural
enough. His partner probably thought (knew?) that they use a
defense similar to that over 1NT, where 2C (and 3C) would show
some other hand type. Perhaps double would have meant clubs (or
any one-suiter)?

Hamman made a good choice when he passed over Nickell\\'s 1S instead

led a heart which Nickell took with dummys ace to play another
one. He was hoping to make four trump tricks, two aces and a
ruff in dummy. East inserted the queen to win the trick. Perhaps
he should now be able to visualise declarers hand: clubs, spades,
three hearts and one or two diamonds. There was no hurry to play
on clubs. A trump looks more tempting.

Is it possible that Wests hearts could be longer? Why else would
East bid 4H and not 4S. Perhaps he hoped that his HA would be
enough to allow drawing trumps and then rely on diamonds. He
was partly right - 4H is a better contract. But with both majors
splitting 4-2 there was no real chance to make game. Clubs were
led and continued, the DJ was allowed to hold the trick. Now
declarer played three rounds of spades, ruffing with the ace,
a good choice, as he would have gone more than one down otherwise.

start by bidding to the theoretically correct level, Nickell
opening his shapely hand in third seat and Hamman giving him
a little leeway. Jansma had no reason to find the club lead,

a club loser and emerge with an overtrick, plus 170.

be the winner (especially not vulnerable) but opposite an American
"good 15 to bad 18" raising seems to be in order. Here, East/West
were in the wrong strain, so Jansma\\'s choice shouldn\\'t matter.
Or should it? If he passes, Hamman may very well protect with
2S, giving East/West the chance to back into diamonds, where
they are cold for nine tricks.

When Jansma got involved after Nickell\\'s strong 1NT opening,
he could have been doubled for at least minus 300, but due to
the vulnerability, the Americans wisely chose to bid 4S instead.
With all finesses working and trumps 3-2, it looks like an "easy
make". Not really. When Nickell made a safety play in trumps
after first cashing one club honor, he lost both a trump trick
and a club ruff, and all Jansma had to do to win a bunch of IMPs
was exit with his last heart.

2NT was a balanced game-force, and even though Hamman denied
any slam interest (by raising 3H to 4H) he also denied a balanced
minimum (else 3NT over 2NT), so there figured to be play for

With two stoppers in spades, 3NT is an easy make, but difficult

about his SK value, but since he could have bid 3D over 2S with
only competitive values, I think a non-forcing, but constructive,
3D over 3C is more what his hand is worth.

If South\\'s hearts are worth five tricks, 3NT is where you want
to be, since you only go down if you get a spade lead, and spades
are 5-2 or 6-1 with the long spade hand also having the CA. But
when Chemla rebid his chunky hearts instead of 2NT (which still
may have led to 4H, of course), North/South ended in 4H, as most
pairs would.

I would expect the choice for most players with the East hand
would be between double and pass, but Abecassis preferred 1D.
After pass or double, North/South may have been content with
a heart part-score, but now momentum carried them all the way
to 4H. All Chemla had to do was ruff a club in dummy before drawing
trumps, and when he started on clubs immediately, he soon had
his ten tricks; plus 420.

North/South are cold for 3D, provided they don\\'t lose a trump

was a good reason for taking the push - at least if you are a
believer in the Law of total tricks. The only downside was his
diamond queen, which on a bad day would mean that neither 3D

when they neither have the distribution nor the trumps to even

defenders have to lead trumps early, and when they duly do, Fantoni
only manages one heart ruff in dummy. Minus 130, and 23 IMPs

of the strong Norwegian international team and Erichsen has a
number of international caps as well. Their American opponents
for the first round are Richie Schwartz and Drew Casen. This
pair have an outstanding record in recent N.A. team championships.
The auction began in a natural vein, and Brogeland\\'s first double
implied a takeout of hearts. When Schwartz bumped the level to
4H, Brogeland\\'s second double had punitive overtones.

A book weak-two bid from Casen had Brogeland quietly entering
the auction with 3C on his enormous black-hand. Schwartz countered
with a fit-showing-jump to 4D. He certainly had the red suits!
Erichsen took the opportunity to introduce his spades, and all
of a sudden Brogeland\\'s hand became gigantic. He advanced with
a 5D cue-bid, and Schwartz bid what he thought his side could
make - 5H. Exactly what Erichsen\\'s 6D is all about - you will
have to ask him. Brogeland gave it one more try with a sort of
"last train" 6H call. Great bid.

A fairly standard non-vulnerable preempt from Brogeland in first
chair. This silenced everyone, which was just as well for E/W
since a spade contract would suffer six losers with the heart
ruff. Erichsen was a spade stopper away from 3NT, though there
was a slight chance of 3NT making on a non-spade lead. Imagine
that North did try 3NT, and East had to lead. The DA or a spade
lead would defeat 3NT - assuming a spade shift after the DA -
but, all other leads allow the questionable game to make. Is
there any cachet in attempting 3NT with the North cards?

Our Norwegian pair shifts to the E/W seats for the next three
boards vs one of the mainstay pairs of the Netherlands international
team; Anton Maas and Vincent Ramondt. Brogeland chose to open
the West hand with a strong notrump. A perfectly acceptable choice
despite the five-card heart suit and maximum. He had all suits
stopped, and didn\\'t have to worry about rebid problems if he
started proceedings with 1H. Erichsen offered a choice of games
with his transfer sequence, and Brogeland made a very good decision
to remain in notrump despite his three spades.

Ramondt\\'s 2S cue-bid showed a limit raise or better in hearts.
Therefore, when Maas rebid 3H, he was catering to the limit raise
only hand-type. The partnership exchanged some cue-bids before
settling in a comfortable 4H. However, note that N/S were the
DQ away from making 6H. A two-one trump break was the only other
requirement. I am pretty sure the auction would have been the
same if South held AQx of diamonds. All in all it would have
been difficult to reach such a prime-fit slam.

Erichsen\\'s shaded 1D opening propelled E/W to the giddy heights

to bolster his SA with a 3S cue-bid. When this wasn\\'t forthcoming,
he settled for a forcing 4D bid after Erichsen\\'s 4C call. Erichsen
may have felt like passing 4D, but was forced to carry on with
5D in their methods. The partnership had done well to avoid 3NT.
That had no chance of success on a spade lead, whereas this contract
had some remote chance of success if the club hook worked, and
there were no nasty red-suit breaks.

The E/W forcing notrump auction didn\\'t get the job done. E/W
can make 5C (on a non-spade lead), more or less, on a double
dummy line of drawing only two rounds of trump before ruffing
the heart on dummy. Then, there is a small matter of playing
diamonds for one loser (ace and a low diamond). A 4H contract
has a chance on a non-spade lead as well. But, declarer will
lose control if the defense continually punches him with spades.
In 3NT, declarer needed the spade ace and king onside.

Brogeland\\'s 3H was a puppet to 3S in the Norwegian methods. A
direct 3NT after 2NT held other connotations. Brogeland suggested
notrump as an alternative at his third turn, but unfortunately
for Erichsen, he couldn\\'t be certain of the heart quality opposite.
His hand was suit-oriented, though the source of tricks in spades
were a consideration. After considerable thought, he plumped

two balanced hands in the 31-32 HCP range to the six-level without

Versace-Guibilo conducted a simple Stayman auction to 3NT. Indeed,
most of the field had the identical auction. Only the vaguaries
of the notrump ranges altered the auction. The D10 would be the
choice of most defenders - maybe an esoteric CJ here and there.
Versace won the queen in dummy, and showed subtle technical expertise.
He led the S9 (unblocking the internal spade spots) to his queen,
and the H5 to the king. The C3 went to the king, ace, and jack.
Now, the H6 towards dummy\\'s Q72. This catered to a doubleton
ace of hearts in West.

West\\'s feathery four-card overcall combined with East\\'s double
of North\\'s "limit raise or better" cue bid gave South a chance
to avoid the bad game. The scheme "pass = minimum, two notrump

show his hand with a two-notrump rebid, but South jumped to three

I\\'ve seen some wild bidders, relying religiously on the "Law
of Total Tricks," preempt with hands like North\\'s. Though a jump
to four spades might goad East into a failing five clubs, Garner
judged wisely to bid a simple two spades; the downside of four
spades was a possible minus 500 via a takeout double and penalty
pass on certain layouts.

East wasn\\'t about to lead one. Three rounds of clubs allowed

A Two-Over-One Game Force auction led, after some probing for
the right strain, to a small slam in the best fit.  There was
little to the play. Declarer took the opening lead with dummy\\'s
DA and led the S10, no doubt intending to play SA and SK regardless.
When West covered, no doubt hoping that East had some spade strength,
declarer claimed an overtrick. Plus 1010, for a modest gain of
36 IMPs.

four spades, minus 420, for a small 10-IMP loss.

Miller rebids 2C where a pass may have worked better (but only

How often do you have a four loser hand, get a raise in your

right he was. But he had an auction to consider, and Lev\\'s strong
1NT overcall scared him. It would have scared me, too. His lack
of intermediates in both spades and diamonds were warning signs,
and even if he knew he could be wrong, passing surely was the
percentage action.

Even though the CK is a doubtful value, it doesn\\'t have to be

out the HA Moss tested spades. With two honors falling from Ramondt,
the odds favored a finesse (by a lot), but since Maas had turned
up with three trumps, at least three diamonds (the opening lead
was the D3, remember) and had opened with 1C, Moss played for

{
Upgrading his singleton king to full value, Erichsen opens a
four-card 1H and catches a forcing raise. Over 4H, Helgemo can\\'t
resist bidding 4S, in spite of his excellent defense. It looks
like he\\'s booked for at least two down, but when Brogeland crashes
his partner\\'s CK at trick one and returns a low club, suit preference
for diamonds, Helgemo gets it right by going up ace. Oh, how
he wished he had the D8 in his own hand, but he doesn\\'t, so in
the end Erichsen takes the setting trick. Minus 200.

{
If it\\'s the last board of the tournament and you are in need
of points, would you have doubled 3NT on the North hand? Maybe
not, but Lev did, perhaps expecting his young opponents to have
overbid or just to cloud the issue. Had Helgemo\\'s spades been
slightly stronger, it could have been a success, but now it only
meant minus 550 instead of minus 400.
