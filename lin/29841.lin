mb|p|mb|1D|nt|bt:  (free commercials here)|pg||
nt|nilsland:  like the polish jump cuebid: I have a stopper, do you have a solid suit p?|pg||
nt|mareczek: it is the method of starting slam bidding in relay auctions|pg||
mb|1S|mb|3N|nt|mareczek: you establish the trump suit and the same bid asks for key cards|pg||
mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|pc|s3|nt|mareczek: later you can check the stoppers or ask for the specific suit|pg||
nt|mareczek: End Signal, one more invention by Slawinsky and his friends from early 60-ties|pg||
nt|mareczek: when they work on strong pass systems|pg||
nt|Vugraphzfc: when leading partner's suit, NS play high from doubleton, low from 3|pg||

mb|4H|mb|p|mb|p|mb|p|nt|Allan Falk: Wow, I would have expected N to pass there; N-S must have some agreement about this NOT showing a spade suit|pg||
