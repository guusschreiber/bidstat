OBJECTIVE

This is a private project I've been wanting to do for a long time.
People claim that bridge bidding has drastically changed over time,
for example that there is more activity in the bidding. Do historical
data support his claim? What, if any, is the nature of the changes?

It is my intention to publish the results in relevant fora, once these
are mature enough to warrant such action.  

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Richard van Haastrecht provided the PBN data through his great website
http://bridgetoernooi.com/. Thanks also to all those people who
invested their time in generating PBN files. 

DESCRIPTION

This project is aimed at analyzing bridge bidding archives. 
Archives of bridge deals are assumed to be in the Portable Bridge
Notation (.pbn files, see
http://home.iae.nl/users/veugent/pbn/pbn_v10.txt) 

The software consists of two parts:

1. pbn2prolog.perl
Perl script for converting each deal in a .pbn file into a Prolog
clause, preserving all information. Subdirectories contain the various
.pbn files. The db*.pl files contain generated Prolog clauses.  
Note: I'm not an experienced Perl program. The code is certainly not
optimal nor efficient.  

2. Prolog files

main.pl 
Main file of a Prolog program (written for SWI-Prolog),

process.pl: 
extract the relevant information per deal for analyzing the bidding 

check.pl
tries to find errorneous deals

definitions.pl: 
derive characteristics of the deal relevant for analyzing
the bidding 

profile.pl
Support predicates for describing a hand/bid profile, to be used for 
generating queries

statistics.pl
Prolog predicates that generate text files in table format
that can be used as input for R. These are stored in the results
subdirectory results/..

aux.pl
support predicates


3. data analysis

- bisstat.R
contains R scripts for analysiing the tables
