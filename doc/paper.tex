\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  In this article we analyse bridge records to study the competitive
  nature of bridge bidding and how this has changed over time.  As
  dataset we use a collection of 19,000 records of deals played in
  Bermuda Bowl World Championships competitions from 1955-2013.  The
  input data is in PBN format and is processed is several steps to
  make a content-based analysis of the auction and the hands involved
  possible.  We view this work as a small first step towards a more
  empirical analysis of bridge bidding.  All data and software of this
  study are publicly available through GitHub.

\section{Introduction}

Expert bridge players regularly discuss the fact that bridge bidding
has changed over the years, for example that auctions have become much
more competitive. This statement is almost certainly true, but there
exists little to no empirical evidence to support this claim. The
objective of this article is to analyse historical records of expert
bridge bidding in order to provide such evidence. An example of a
concrete question we would like to answer is: can we empirically show
that the frequency of opening a balanced hand with 11-12 HCP has
increased? . In order to answer such questions we need to analyse for
each deal both the hands and the auction. As a consequence we require
some limited form of reasoning on top of database querying.  In this
study we achieve this by manipulating the data in a Prolog database.
As input data we use here a set of some 19,000 hand records played
during Bermuda Bowl championships in te period 1955-2013.

Taking a wider perspective, we see this study as one possible step
towards a more evidence-based approach to the theory of bridge
bidding. Through channels such as Bridge Base Online
(BBO)\footnote{\url{http://www.bridgebase.com}} more and more hand
records become available for analysis. This provides us with data that
can be used to analyse the effectiveness of particular bidding
agreements. An example would be a comparison of the Multi opening and
the natural Weak Two.

In the next section we discuss the overall approach. \secref{data}
describes the data and the data processing methods.  In
\secref{analysis} we use the processed data to gather statistical
information about four specific research questions related to the
competitive nature of bridge bidding.  \secref{discussion} discusses
the results and limitations of this study. We also reflect on posible
future directions.

\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}

As input we used hand records encoded with in the Portable Bridge
Notation version 2.1 \cite{pbn21}. This plain-text notation is derived
from a popular notation for chess (PGN) and adapted to bridge by
members of the Internet newsgroup
\instance{rec.games.bridge}. Numerous people have published sets of
hand records in PBN format. Another popular format is the LIN (.lin)
format used by BBO. Converters between PBN and LIN exists.

Each hand record contains metadata about the event (e.g., time, place,
tournament), table data (e.g., player names) and deal data (e.g.,
vulnerability, hands, auction, play).  In this study we focus on data
about hands and auction. We process the PBN data in four steps:

\begin{enumerate}
\item We first transform the PBN text with an information-preserving
  Perl parser into a set of Prolog clauses. We opt for Prolog because
  Prolog-style data manipulation is excellently suited for the type of
  reasoning we need to do with the data.
\item In the second step we derive for each deal Prolog facts about
  the hands and the auction, for example that the player in second
  position has an \slot{unbalanced} hand with a \slot{1246}
  distribution and \slot{8 HCP}, and has made a \slot{jump overcall}
  at the \slot{3 level}.
\item Subsequently, we create data tables that contain for every deal
  the year and one or more values for a particular bidding feature,
  such as whether a player has made a \slot{preemptive bid}.
\item In the final step we process the data tables with statistical
  software (spreadsheets for simple operations, R for more complex
  statistical manipulations).
\end{enumerate}

In the next section we discuss the data processing performed in step 2
in more detail.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}

In this study we analysed 19,223 hand records\footnote{%
  The PBN files contained 19,724 records; 501 records were put aside
  because no (correct) hand or auction information was available in
  the record.}  from 24 Bermuda Bowls over a period of 60 years (see
\tblref{data}).  The number of deals per tournament varies; recent
tournaments typically have more records.  We selected the Bermuda Bowl
as dataset because it is the only tournament for which data is
available over a long period of time.

\begin{table}
\centering\footnotesize
\caption{Hand records used in this study. Rowd indicate decades;
  columns a particular year within  a decade. Hand records with
  incomplete or erroneous hand or auction datahave been left out.}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

From each record the following data is used in this study: 
\begin{itemize}
\item year in which it was played
\item the four hands (list with dealer first)
\item vulnerability
\item auction, including final contract and declarer
\end{itemize}

The data is represented in a computation-friendly way. For example,
the auction is represented as a list of numbers. Here is one sample
auction\footnote{%
  Auction on board 1 of the 1955 Bermuda Bowl between USA and Great
  Britain. NS: Mathe-Rosen; EW: Reese-Shapiro.}:

\begin{code}
    [12,13,7,0,0,21,22,31,32,0,0,0]
\end{code}

Each number encodes a bid: 12 stands for 1$\diamondsuit$, 13 for
1$\heartsuit$, 21 for 2$\clubsuit$, etc. The numbers 0 and 7 encode a
pass and a double, respectively\footnote{%
  The bid codes are chosen in such a way that \texttt{code modulo 10}
  gives a unique denomination (suit 1-4; NT: 5; double: 7; redouble:
  8), and \texttt{code div 10} gives the level.}

For each record we derived three types of additional facts: 
\begin{itemize}
\item hand features that can be derived from the 13 cards of one
  player, e.g. high-card points (HCP), distribution,
  balanced/semi-balanced/unbalanced, 1/2/3-suited;
\item features of a bid independent of the auction, e.g.  major/minor,
  level;
\item features of a bid dependent on the auction, e.g. opening,
  overcall (direct, ``live''), jump (single/double/...).
\end{itemize}
 
These features form the basis for generating the data tables used for
empirical analysis. 

\section{Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

\subsection{Preliminaries}

As stated, our objective is to analyse whether competitive bidding
style has changed over time.  Before diving into this we need to
consider whether the fact that in earlier days hands were not
computer-dealt influences the dataset. We have not studied this
feature in every detail, but \tblref{balanced-first-hand} gives some
indication. In this table we see the frequency of the dealer holding a
balanced hand. The frequencies in the table suggest there is no strong
effect of dealing by hand (or at least in the Bermuda Bowl shuffling
was done well). In fact, if we aggregate the data in two subsets,
``seventies and before'' and ``eighties and later'', we see that both
sets have the same frequency (0.47) of balanced hands. Nevertheless,
when we formulate concrete research questions we will take care that,
whenever possible, this factor is ruled out or minimized.

\begin{table}
\caption{Frequency of the dealer holding a balanced hand (4333, 4432
  or 5332).} 
\label{tbl:balanced-first-hand}
\centering\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{|c|r|r|r|}
\hline
\bf \ Decade \ & \bf \ Balanced \ & \bf \ Total \  & \bf \ \% Balanced \ \\ \hline 
50-59 & 607 & 1,207 & 0.50 \\
60-69 & 290 & 832 & 0.35 \\
70-79 & 531 & 1,023 & 0.52 \\
80-89 & 392 & 894 & 0.44 \\
90-99 & 774 & 1,657 & 0.47 \\
00-09 & 4,418 & 9,072 & 0.49 \\
10-13 & 2,078 & 4,538 & 0.46 \\ 
\hline
Total & 9,090 & 19,223 &  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For this study we selected four concrete questions to get insight into
the overall issue of competitiveness:
\begin{enumerate}
\item How frequent is a balanced hand with 11-12 HCP opened in first
  and second position?
\item In cases where the dealer holds a six-card suit with 0-9 HCP, is
  the hand opened and at what level? 
\item How frequent are preemptive bids? Also, what is relationship
  between suit length and level in preemptive bids? 
\item Whats is the frequency of contested auctions (i.e. auctions in
  which both sides participate)?   
\end{enumerate}

The questions cover by no means the full spectrum of competitiveness,
but will hopefully give us some insight into the issue.   

\subsection{Opening a balanced hand with 11-12 HCP}

As first question we tackle a topic which is accepted as common
wisdom: nowadays balanced hands with 11 or 12 HCP are opened 
much more frequent in first and second hand.  With our preprocessed
dataset it is relatively straightforward to gather evidence about this
question. 

\begin{table}
\caption{Frequency op opening a balanced with 11-12 HCP in first
  or second position.}
\label{tbl:opening-11-12-bal-2}
\centering\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{|c|r|r|r|r|}
\hline
\bf \ Decade \ & \bf \ Pass \ & \bf \ Opening \ & \bf \ Total \  & 
\bf \ \% Opened \ \\ \hline 
50-59 & 105 & 66 & 171 & 0.39\\
60-69 & 44 & 44 & 88 & 0.50\\
70-79 & 74 & 80 & 154 & 0.52\\
80-89 & 47 & 61 & 108 & 0.56\\
90-99 & 60 & 133 & 193 & 0.69\\
00-09 & 340 & 803 & 1143 & 0.70\\
10-13 & 164 & 354 & 518 & 0.68 \\ 
\hline
Total & 834 & 1,541 & 2,375 & \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\tblref{opening-11-12-bal-2} shows the results. About 12.5\% (2427) of
the records fit the profile. Note that we only consider the second
hand if the first hand does not fit the ``11-12 balanced'' profile;
otherwise the action of the first hand would biase the outcome.  The
frequencies are aggregated per decade.

The percentages in the table suggest that a major change in style took
place in the nineties, when the frequency of opening 11-12 balanced
hands went up from ``about half'' to ``about two-third''. After the
nineties no major change appears to have taken place.  The results
also suggest that there was a marked increase in frequency in the
sixties.
 
\subsection{Opening a hand with a  6-card and 0-9 HCP}

For the second question we select hand records in which the dealer has
some 6-card and less than 10 HCP. The reason we only look at the
dealer position is because in other positions the variation of the
previous bids could easily biase the results (or better: we lacked the
time and energy to consider all the consequences of such a situation).
If the hand was opened we record the level at which it was opened,
which ranged from 1-4.

  6-card suit and less than 10 HCP. Data is aggregated per decade.}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\tblref{weak-two-1st} lists the results, again aggregated per decade.
About 7.5\% (1472) of the records match the profile. Since the
eighties there is a marked increase in the frequency with which these
hands are opened.  Unfortunately, the number of deals for the eighties
is very low. On manual inspection most hands that were opened at the
1-level turn out to be non-standard cases from the 1987 Bermuda Bowl.
It is therefore more useful to look at the openings at the higher
levels.

\insertfig{weak-two-1st}{\textwidth}{Cumulative frequencies of for a
  2/3/4-level opening with a  6 card and less than 10 HCP. Data is
  aggregated per decade.}

\figref{weak-two-1st} shows the cumulative frequencies for openings
these hands at 2/3/4-level.  Unlike the 11-12 balanced hands the
frequency appears to keep rising after the initial increase.  Also,
the frequency with which such a hand is opened at the 3-level is
increasing. If we check the data for the non-vulnerable
situation\footnote{%
  These data are not included in the paper; see the results directory
  in the GitHub repository} this trend is even more prominent. For
example, in 2013 14 of these hands were opened at the 3-level, whereas
only 6 at the 2-level.

\subsection{Preempts}

Our third question is related to the previous one, but is more
generally aimed at the frequency and nature of preempts. Giving a
precise definition of the notion of preempt is not trivial. In this
study we consider a bid to be a preempt if it satisfies the following
conditions: (1) it is a jump bid in a suit; (2) the bid is either an
opening or an overcall\footnote{%
  Overcalls can be ``direct'' (2$^{nd}$ position, after an opening) or
  ``live'' (4$^{th}$ position, after an opening and a response)}; (3)
the bidder has less than 10 HCP; (4) the bid is made in the first
round of bidding.  This definition might be overly restrictive (for
example, a weak jump bid after an original pass is not considered a
preempt), but at least we know with high certainty that it is indeed a
preemptive bid.

We also want to get information about the relationship between suit
length and the level at which the preempt is made. To this end we
compute for each preempt the L value, which we define as the length of
the longest suit minus the level at which the bid is made.  Thus, a
low value of L indicates an aggressive preempt.

\begin{table}
\caption{Frequency of preempts, aggregated per decade. The last column
lists the mean of the length of the longest suit minus the level at
which the preempt is made (the L value).}
\centering\footnotesize
\label{tbl:preempt}
\begin{tabular}{|c|r|r|r|c|c|}
\hline
\bf \ Decade \ & \bf Preempt \ & \bf Total  \ & 
\bf \% Preempt & \bf \ L (mean) \  \\ 
\hline\hline
50-59 & 74 & 1,207 & 0.06 & 3.82 \\ 
60-69 & 38 & 832& 0.05 & 3.87 \\
70-79 & 52 & 1,023 & 0.05 & 3.79 \\
80-89 & 69 & 894 & 0.08 & 3.61 \\
90-99 & 143 & 1,657 & 0.09 & 3.71 \\
00-09 & 955 & 9,072 & 0.11 & 3.82 \\ 
10-13 & 533 & 4,538 & 0.12 & 3.50 \\
\hline
Total  & 1,864 & 19,223 &  & \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\tblref{preempt} shows the results for the Bermuda Bowl data set. The
frequency of preempts appears to have increased constantly since the
eighties. Over the course of six decades the frequency has roughly
speaking doubled. It should be pointed out that this query might be
biased somewhat due to the manual dealing of hands in older
tournaments. However, the increase is much larger than could be
explained by this bias (if there is such a bias at all, see
\tblref{balanced-first-hand}),

It is difficult to draw conclusions from the mean L values. Given the
earlier results we would expect a decrease, but in particular the data
from the period 2000-2009 do not support this.  We see an decrease in
recent years, but more data is needed to verify that this is not an
accidental result.  We should also point out that the L value
overestimates the two-suited hands.  For now we can only state that
the length/level property of preempts needs to be studied in more
depth in a follow-up study.

\subsection{Contested auction}

Finally, we look at the frequency of contested auctions, i.e.,
auctions in which both sides participate. Defining what precisely a
contested auction is requires some care. We like to exclude doubles of
final contracts after some rounds of bidding. We decided to take only
the first two rounds of bidding into account and consider it contested
if both sides make some non-pass bid. This definition has some minor
flaws; for example, it will count a lead-directing double of Stayman
as a contested auction.  Deals which are passed all round are
considered ``non applicable'' (51 deals in this dataset).

\begin{table}
\caption{Frequency of contested auctions, aggregated per
decade. Passed hands (51 in total) are left out.}  
\label{tbl:contested-auction}
\centering\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{|c|r|r|r|r|}
\hline
\bf \ Decade \ & \bf \ Contested \ & \bf \ Total \  & 
\bf \ \% Contested \ \\ \hline
50-59 & 561 & 1,194 & 0.47 \\
60-69 & 363 & 831 & 0.44\\
70-79 & 523 & 1,016 & 0.51\\
80-89 & 490 & 887 & 0.55\\
90-99 & 825 & 1,650 & 0.50\\
00-09 & 4,783 & 9,063 & 0.53\\
10-13 & 2,240 & 4,531 & 0.49\\
\hline
Total  & 9,785 & 19,172 & \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\tblref{contested-auction} shows the results. We expected to see a
marked increase, but this is not a completely obvious result if we
look at the aggregated frequencies in the table. Given the fact that
the number of hand records per tournament has a relatively high
variation we decided to do an additional analysis, using a more
stratified method. We partition the complete dataset into subsets of
200 records, ordered by year. For each subset we compute the average
year and \% of contested auctions.

\insertfig{contested-auction}{\textwidth}{Scatterplot and regression
  line of the relation between year (X-axis) and frequency of a
  contested auction (Y-axis). Each circle stands for a set of 200 hand
  records. P-value of the linear model: 0.0324}

\figref{contested-auction} shows the results of this second analysis
in the form of a scatterplot with a regression line. Each circle
represents one subset of 200 records. The linera model represented by
the regression line shows a small increase of contested auctions over
time. The model has p-value of 0.324, which suggests that the model
falls within the 95\% confidence interval. We conclude that the
expected increase over time is not inconsistent with the data, but
that the increase rate is not as large as one might have thought
(4.5\% in the period 1955-2013 according to the estimated model).

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

The results of this study basically confirms our intuitions. Some
nuances are interesting though. The style of opening light balanced
hands has not really changed since the nineties, whereas preemptive
styles still seem to keep evolving. Also, we probably underestimate
how competitive the auctions of our predecessors were.

From our perspective the main point of the paper is that \emph{this
type of study can be done} . In this analysis we have only used a
fraction of the hand records available online. Services like BBO
produce more data every week.  We should take advantage of these data
to work on a more evidence-based approach to the theory of bridge
bidding.  Let's put our bidding conventions to the test. To do this we
would need to take into account the result of the board (information
not used in this study). The author intends to study the effectiveness
of the Multi 2$\diamondsuit$ in a follow-up study.  In general, we
would like to make a plea for a community effort to share software and
data in order to make large-scale empirical analysis possible.

This study has a number of limitations. Firstly, a significant number
of hand records contains errors. We have tried to detect these records
automatically, but it is almost certain that we missed out on some.
This may have influenced the results, although it is unlikely it will
have had a large effect. Secondly, due to the uneven distribution of
hands over the time periods in the study the result have to be
interpreted with some care, in particular those about subsets of hand
records. Thirdly, the size of the Bermuda Bowl has grown over time,
with more and more teams participating. This may have lowered the
average level of expertise of the players involved and thus biased the
results of this study.
